/*EDUCATIONAL TEXT
So both of the hitSnooze methods passed! Now we know our bug isn't a result of the operations we're performing on variables... so we must be using the wrong variables.

Let's look again at the code for our hitSnooze method: 
myClock.hitSnooze = function() {
    this.snoozeTime = this.alarmTime + 10;
};
