/*EDUCATIONAL TEXT
Now that we've structured the data our tests will use and hardcoded our known correct outcomes, let's finish up. 

The steps that remain are outlined in the exercise instructions. 

Try to do them on your own! If you need more help, check the hint.
*/

/*EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS
Set the value of the items in the actOutcomes array using the operations from hitSnooze that we want to test
For both of our operations, check if the value of an operation's actual outcome is equal to it's known correct outcome
Record each result in a boolean
Log your results to the console "Is operation 1 valid? Yes"
*/

/*EXERCISE HINT
To perform the check, you'll need to loop through one array, and then use an if statement to check if the values of the items at that index are equal.

Don't forget to return a boolean to record the outcome of the test!
